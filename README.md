# Expense Tracker Application

Hey, actually i will explain you briefly about why this PWA(progressive web app) app. Let's see what is PWA app, so as we developer we all know our strengths and weakness. And in IT world there is one weakness that, if you want to build website and app for particular then you have to hire multiple developers for ANDROID for IOS AND FOR WEBSITE.

But with the help of PWA technology we can achieve all this with one code. And it reduces lots of time for creating and also very less efforts for maintaining one code base instead of maintaining dofferent for each domain. With the help of service worker you can achieve app like behaviour for this PWA app.
the Expense Tracker app is to make a easy your life, by making a khatta book(money related transaction details) like we do in ancient times but in this hi-tech world we present you with a application with lots of feature like time, attachment, extraInfo, totally client side app, group splitter and many more.
